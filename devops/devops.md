# Azure DevOps

- Azure DevOps (AZDO) is a separate offering from Microsoft and unrelated to Azure.
- It is a way of organising and managing your code and artefacts
- AZDO is registered as an enterprise application with Azure
- AZDO has an "integration" point to Azure where you can invite users you set up in AZDO to your Azure platform
- This is activated when you register AZDO with Azure

> The owner of the AZDO can be changed by the owner on the organisation settings page in AZDO.  
> There can only be one owner at a time
> Microsoft may be able to switch the owner for you if you are unable
